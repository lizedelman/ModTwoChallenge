          We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. You need
          the dark in order to show the light. It's so important to do something
          every day that will make you happy. Just go back and put one little
          more happy tree in there. Only eight colors that you need. Son of a
          gun.
        </p>

          Let's build some happy little clouds up here. If we're going to have
          animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of
          them. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Making all
          those little fluffies that live in the clouds. We have all at one time
          or another mixed some mud. The shadows are just like the highlights,
          but we're going in the opposite direction.

          Little short strokes. This present moment is perfect simply due to the
          fact you're experiencing it. It is a lot of fun. You can spend all day
          playing with mountains. Every highlight needs it's own personal
          shadow. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. What the
          devil.
